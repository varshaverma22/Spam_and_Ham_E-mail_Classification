# Spam and Ham E-mail Classification
The Spam and Ham Email Classification project utilizes machine learning techniques to develop a model that can accurately classify emails as either spam or ham.The project involves the following steps:

1. Data Collection: A dataset of labeled emails, categorized as spam or ham, is collected to serve as the training data for the machine learning model.

2. Data Preprocessing: The collected dataset is preprocessed to extract relevant features from the email content. This may involve techniques such as tokenization, removing stop words, and converting text data into numerical representations.

3. Feature Engineering: Additional features can be engineered from the email content to improve the model's performance. This could include extracting information from the email subject line, sender information, or other metadata.

4. Model Selection: A suitable machine learning algorithm is chosen for the email classification task. Common approaches include Naive Bayes.

5. Model Training: The selected machine learning model is trained on the preprocessed dataset. The training process involves feeding the data to the model and adjusting its internal parameters to learn patterns and characteristics associated with spam and ham emails.

6. Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using a separate test dataset to assess its performance. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are used to measure the model's effectiveness in correctly classifying emails.

Throughout the project, the focus is on leveraging machine learning algorithms to build an effective and efficient system for classifying emails as Spam or Ham. The goal is to provide users with a reliable tool that reduces the risk of unwanted or harmful emails reaching their inbox.
